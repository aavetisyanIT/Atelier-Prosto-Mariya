					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Atelierprostomariya.com, owned and operated by Atelier
					Prosto Mariya Inc. ("we" or "us")Takes the protection
					and proper use of your personal and non-personal
					information very seriously. We want you to understand
					what information we may collect from you, how we may
					use such information, and the choices you have
					regarding our collection and use of this information.
					Accordingly, this policy ("Privacy Policy") explains
					how we collect, use and disclose your personal and
					other information through this website, including the
					mobile version to the extent applicable (collectively,
					the "Website"). We will treat your information
					consistent with this Privacy Policy unless you have
					consented otherwise. Also, you may opt-out of certain
					uses and disclosures of your personal information, as
					further explained in this Privacy Policy.
					<br />
					<br />
					This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we
					may obtain through other means, including offline or
					online in another forum. This Privacy Policy also does
					not apply to other third-party websites outside of or
					apart from the Website to which we may link. When
					linking to another site, you must review that website’s
					privacy notice as other websites may not treat
					information collected online in the same manner as we
					do.
				</p>
				<hr className='major' />
				<h2>YOUR CONSENT</h2>
				<p>
					By accessing and using the Website, you consent to our
					collection, use and disclosure of your information in
					accordance with this Privacy Policy and you agree to be
					legally bound by its terms, as the same may be changed
					from time to time. However, as explained in this
					Privacy Policy, you do have certain choices about the
					information we collect and how we use that information,
					so please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO
					NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY
					POLICY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.
				</p>
				<hr className='major' />
				<h2>How We Collect and Use Personal Information</h2>
				<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
				<p>
					During your access or use of the Website, including but
					not limited to your order of products or services, or
					setting up an account with us, you may be asked to
					voluntarily provide certain personal information, such
					as your name, email address, postal address, credit
					card number, telephone number, mobile phone number, fax
					number, gender, etc. It is always your choice whether
					to provide this personal information; however, without
					providing some of the requested information, certain
					features of the Website and services we provide will
					not be accessible or available, and you may not be able
					to conduct transactions or make purchases through the
					Website. For example, providing an email address is one
					of the prerequisites to placing an order through the
					Website. Additionally, if you want to set up an account
					with us to make future ordering easier, you will also
					be required to provide certain personal information –
					though setting up an account is not necessary for you
					to make purchases through the Website.
				</p>
				<h3>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					We may use your personal information to contact and
					correspond with you, to respond to your inquiries, to
					process sales transactions and payments, to facilitate
					and enhance your use of the Website, to email or
					otherwise inform you about our products, services
					and/or special promotions or marketing efforts, as well
					as those of our related companies and other third
					parties, and for other purposes reasonably related to
					us, our business, our products and/or our services. For
					example, if you make a purchase through the Website, we
					may use your personal information collected during that
					transaction to market products and services to you that
					we think may interest you.
					<br />
					<br />
					Except as stated herein, we do not sell, rent, or share
					your personal information with third parties. However,
					we may permit our suppliers, vendors and subcontractors
					to access your personal information in connection with
					performing services for us. For example, in order to
					process your transactions, we may share your personal
					information with certain third parties, such as your
					credit card issuer, a third-party credit verification
					company, the product handler and the delivery service.
					We may also share your shipping information (i.e.,
					name, shipping address, etc.) in the event any goods or
					products you order are shipped to you from someone
					other than us. Before personal information is disclosed
					to such a party, we use reasonable efforts to require
					the party to agree to protect the privacy and
					confidentiality of your personal information.
					<br />
					<br />
					We also may share your personal information with our
					related companies who are required to protect the
					privacy and confidentiality of your personal
					information under the same standards as set forth in
					this Privacy Policy. Such related companies may use
					your personal information to provide products and
					services on our behalf and/or to provide you with
					information about their own products and services which
					we believe you might be interested in. We may also
					selectively share your non-sensitive personal
					information with third parties who we believe may have
					products or services that would interest you. If you
					want to opt-out of us sharing your non-sensitive
					personal information in this manner, please contact us.
					<br />
					<br />
					We also may transfer your personal information (i.e.,
					name, e-mail address, etc.) in connection with an
					actual or perspective sale, merger and change of
					control or similar transaction involving us or our
					assets.
					<br />
					<br />
					You will be notified via email (sent to the email
					address specified in your account) or a notice or
					updated Privacy Policy on our Website upon any transfer
					of control of your personal information apart from as
					otherwise set forth herein.
					<br />
					<br />
					Finally, we may disclose your personal information: (a)
					as required by law or legal process (including, but not
					limited to, in response to a subpoena or court order);
					(b) to investigate suspected fraud, harassment,
					intellectual property infringement, potential harm to
					persons or property, or other activity which is or has
					the potential to violate any law, rule, or regulation
					or which may expose us to potential legal or financial
					liability; or (c) to investigate suspected violations
					of any terms or policies applicable to the Website or
					the products and services provided by us or our third
					party providers or related companies; (d) as required
					for legal or regulatory compliance; (e) in connection
					with internal or external audits; and/or (f) any other
					purpose for which valid consent is obtained.

				<h3>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
				<p>
					Like many other websites and applications, we may
					automatically collect certain information, which may or
					may not be personally identifiable information,
					regarding those who access and/or use our Website. Such
					information may include, among other things, the
					Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer, your
					device ID, the IP address of your Internet service
					provider, your zip code, the date and time you access
					the Website, the Internet address of a referring
					website, the operating system you are using, the
					sections or pages of the Website that you visit, and
					the images and content viewed. Some of the ways in
					which we may collect and use such information is
					further described below.
				</p>
				<h3>COOKIES, TRACKING PIXELS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
				<p>
					A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string
					of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to
					a web browser and is stored by the browser. The
					identifier is then sent back to the server each time
					the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies do
					not typically contain any information that personally
					identifies a user, but personal data that we store
					about you may be linked to the information stored in
					and obtained from cookies. The Website may use cookies,
					a type of technology that installs a small amount of
					information on a website user's computer or other
					device to permit a website to, for example, recognize
					future visits using that computer or device. We may
					also use other similar technologies (including, without
					limitation, tracking pixels, as described further
					below, and other identifiers) to gather non-personally
					identifiable information. We may use cookies and
					similar technologies on the Website to customize your
					visit, to enable us to enhance our service, or for
					other purposes related to our business. For example,
					information provided through cookies may be used to
					recognize you as a previous user of the Website so you
					do not have to enter your personal information (i.e.,
					name, address, etc.) every time you visit the Website
					to purchase a product or service and to offer
					personalized content such as reminders of products you
					previously ordered or may need/want. You may choose to
					decline cookies by adjusting your browser preferences
					but doing so may affect your use of the Website and
					your ability to access certain features of the Website
					or engage in transactions through the Website. If you
					delete your cookies, change browsers or use a different
					cookie, cookies that we may use (or an opt-out cookie)
					may no longer work, which may impact or limit certain
					features you can use on the Website.
					<br />
					<br />
					We may also employ, either directly or through third
					parties, tracking pixels. Tracking pixels are tiny,
					transparent graphics with a unique identifier, similar
					in function to cookies, and are used to provide
					analytical information concerning the user experience
					as well as to support custom marketing activities for
					users of the Website. In contrast to cookies, which are
					stored on a user's computer hard drive, tracking pixels
					are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use
					tracking pixels to help us better manage content, such
					as by improving the user interface or improving our
					marketing programs. We also may use non-personally
					identifiable information to create aggregate tracking
					information reports regarding user demographics,
					traffic patterns and purchases and may link tracking
					information with personal information provided by
					users. Cookies and tracking pixels may also be used to
					track your purchases for the purpose of reporting sales
					anonymously (i.e., without transferring any of your
					personal information) to third parties that you used to
					access the Website including, but not limited to,
					blogs, advertising networks or comparison shopping
					websites that link users to our Website.
				</p>
				<h3>OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					We may obtain information about you from third party
					sources and combine that information with data
					collected through the Website, including personal
					information. This combined information may result in,
					among other things, a profile about you, which we may
					use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
				</p>
				<h3>HOW WE USE NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					Your non-personally identifiable information can be
					used by us for any lawful purpose and may be shared
					with any number of third parties, provided that such
					information provided by us does not specifically
					identify you. Such information may be permanently
					archived for future use. Some examples of how we may
					use non-personal information are for system
					administration purposes, analytics and to improve the
					Website. Other examples of how we may use such
					information are provided above, such as "Interest-Based
					Advertising." We also may use location data,
					preferences, or other information received from the
					Website, including through your mobile device, to send
					you tailored marketing messages. Additionally, we may
					use non-personally identifiable information to engage
					in interactive, real-time discussions with users, which
					we or the users may initiate. We limit our employees'
					access to personal information to those employees with
					a business reason for knowing such information, and
					those employees will use the information only for
					appropriate business reasons. All non-personal
					information, know-how, techniques, comments,
					suggestions, feedback, questions, ideas and content you
					submit to us using the Website shall be treated for all
					purposes as non-confidential and non-proprietary. You
					acknowledge and agree that by submitting any such
					content using this Website, you grant to us an
					unrestricted, irrevocable license to use, reproduce,
					display, perform, modify, transmit and distribute such
					content for any purpose, including, but not limited to,
					the development, manufacture, marketing, distribution
					and sale of products and services incorporating such
					content and information.
				</p>
				<hr className='major' />
				<h2>Opt-Out Process/Options and Additional Terms</h2>
				<h3>OPT-OUT PROCESS/OPTIONS</h3>
				<p>
					If you receive an email from us, you may unsubscribe
					from future unsolicited emails through a link,
					typically at the bottom of the e-mail. Removal from
					future e-mails shall occur promptly thereafter.
					However, if you again take action which independently
					puts you on our email list (such as submitting an
					inquiry, making a purchase, etc.), you may again
					receive emails from which you can again unsubscribe.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you have an account with us, you may opt-out of
					unsolicited communications by updating your account's
					personal information settings. In addition, you may
					request that we delete your personal information by
					contacting us and we will process your request within a
					reasonable time after receipt. Please note that we do
					not respond to or honour "do not track" (a/k/a DNT)
					signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web
					browsers. However, if you do not want to receive
					targeted advertisements, then you can opt-out of being
					tracked by our vendors.
				</p>
				<h3>SECURITY</h3>
				<p>
					When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit
					card number on our order forms, we utilize technology
					that encrypts the transmission of that information
					using secure socket layer ("SSL") technology.
					Non-sensitive personal information, such as name,
					address and emails, collected outside of the ordering
					process may not be encrypted when transmitted to our
					servers. We use commercially reasonable security
					measures to protect the confidentiality of all personal
					information submitted to us both during transmission
					and after we receive it. However, we cannot ensure or
					warrant the security of any information you transmit to
					us and you do so at your own risk.
				</p>
				<h3>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES; LINKS</h3>{' '}
				<p>
					The Website may contain links to other websites or
					Internet resources, which are provided for your
					convenience only. When you click on one of those links,
					you are contacting another website or Internet
					resource. We have not reviewed the information and
					content included on any third-party website and make no
					representations with respect to any third-party
					website. We have no responsibility or liability for, or
					control over, those other websites or resources or
					their collection, use and disclosure of your
					information. We suggest that you read the privacy
					policy and terms of use of each such website. We
					expressly disclaim all responsibility relating to your
					access to and use of such third-party websites and the
					information and content contained therein. You may not
					create links to this Website without our express
					written consent.

					disclosure of your information will be governed by the
					version of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time of
