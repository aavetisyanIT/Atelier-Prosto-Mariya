				6 Tailor Services That Can Benefit Your Wardrobe{' '}
			</h2>
			<h4>
				A lot of people think that a tailor’s only skills are
				hemming garments and adjusting a dress’s waistline. But an
				expert tailor can do so much more than that! Professional
				tailor services can help you hold onto your favorite pieces
				in your wardrobe for a longer period of time. They can also
				take a piece of clothing you simply like and transform it
				into something you love. Here are 6 ways that using a tailor
				can help you make the most of every item in your closet!
			</h4>
			<h2>1. Raise Your Neckline for Increased Modesty</h2>
			<p className='paragraph'>
				Does a certain shirt or dress have you showing off a little
				more than you’d like? Wearing an undershirt may seem like an
				easy solution, but sometimes that can ruin the look of your
				outfit. Get the neckline raised instead! A tailor will keep
				the integrity of your top while helping you only show off
				what you want to.
			</p>
			<h2>2. Change the Neckline Style of a Shirt or Dress</h2>
			<p className='paragraph'>
				We all have our favorite necklines that we think look best
				on us and make us feel the most comfortable. But not every
				shirt that catches your eye will have your perfect neckline.
				The right tailor can make sure you get the neckline that’s
				best for you on the top or dress that you love! You can get
				the collar on a shirt removed or transform a crew neck into
				a boatneck.{' '}
			</p>
			<h2>3. Shorten Your Shirt for a More Flattering Look</h2>
			<p className='paragraph'>
				A long shirt can look awkward, especially if you have a
				shorter torso. Shirts that are too long are unflattering and
				sometimes uncomfortable. A tailor can shorten your top to
				the length that’s perfect for you, whether that’s a crop top
				or just a standard shirt length. This alteration results
				will be the most flattering silhouette possible!
			</p>
			<h2>4. Add a Zipper for an Easier Fit</h2>
			<p className='paragraph'>
				Sometimes getting into a form-fitting dress can be a real
				struggle. You might think this is just the price you’ll have
				to pay for looking good. But an expert tailor can help you
				change that by adding a zipper. This will make getting
				dressed up easier and faster. You won’t have to stress as
				much about sucking it in!
			</p>
			<h2>
				5. Shorten Dress Straps to Eliminate the Need for Pulling
			</h2>
			<p className='paragraph'>
				When a dress’s straps don’t fit perfectly, you end up
				spending the entire time you’re wearing it pulling up the
				straps. This isn’t a practical solution because it doesn’t
				actually fix anything. It’s annoying, and it looks wrong. It
				is possible to have straps that fit correctly. All you have
				to do is take your dress to a tailor to shorten them.
			</p>
			<h2>6. Amp up the Style on Your Leather Jacket</h2>
			<p className='paragraph'>
				A tailor can do more than just size alterations.
				Professional tailor services will also include making your
				garments even more stylish. Working on leather takes extra
				skill. But if you have the right tailor, your leather jacket
				can look even cooler with all the pockets, zippers, buttons,
				and details you want!

				5 Secrets to Prolonging the Life of Your Clothing
			</h2>
			<h4>
				If you’re not caring for your clothing properly, you’re
				hurting your bank account. You’ll have to part with items
				you love more quickly and go clothes shopping more
				frequently. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Here are
				five tips for prolonging the life of your clothing and
				minimizing the need for clothing repairs.
			</h4>
			<h2>1. Read Your Fabric Care Labels</h2>
			<p className='paragraph'>
				Most of us ignore the fabric care instructions that come on
				the tags of our clothing. But in doing so, you’re actually
				decreasing the lifespan of these items. If a garment says
				it’s dry clean only, you shouldn’t be washing it at home.
				Going to the drycleaners can feel like a chore, but if it
				means your clothing lasts longer, it’s worth it!
				<br />
				<br />
				Some clothing will not require dry cleaning, but you may
				need to hand wash it. You can find other special
				instructions on the fabric care label such as the ideal
				temperature at which you should wash the fabric.
			</p>
			<h2>2. Sort Your Clothes Before You Do Laundry</h2>

			<p className='paragraph'>
				When it’s time to do laundry, it can be tempting to just
				throw everything into the machine at once. But this is the
				fastest way to wear out some of your favorite clothing
				items. If you wash your zip-up jackets with your delicate
				blouses, you run the risk of damaging them.
				<br />
				<br />
				When your items have different cleaning instructions, they
				shouldn’t be mixed together. Always separate your items
				before you do a load of laundry. You’ll enjoy longer-lasting
				clothing!
			</p>
			<h2>3. Protect Delicates with a Garment Bag</h2>

			<p className='paragraph'>
				Your delicate items are just that: delicate. You should be
				treating them differently than other items in your wardrobe.
				The best thing you can do to protect your lingerie, baby
				clothing, sweaters, and other delicate items is putting them
				in a mesh bag before washing them and keeping them in the
				garment bag in the dryer. Garment bags are affordable and
				easy to find. You can purchase them in a multi-pack online.
			</p>
			<h2>4. Wear Your Work Clothing Less Frequently</h2>

			<p className='paragraph'>
				The most expensive articles of clothing you own are probably
				the ones you wear to work. Decrease the length of time you
				wear these by taking them off as soon as you get home. This
				will also protect your good blouses and suits from stains,
				snags, and tears. This will definitely help prolong the life
				of your professional clothing.
			</p>
			<h2>5. Have Your Tailor on Speed-Dial</h2>

			<p className='paragraph'>
				Okay, maybe having your tailor on speed-dial is a little
				extreme. But once you actually start taking advantage of
				your tailor’s services, you’ll get a lot more longevity out
				of your wardrobe. When your clothing rips or tears, a
				tailor’s clothing repair service can make them good as new!
				If you change sizes or just don’t love the way certain
				articles of clothing fit, don’t throw them out. Take them to
				a tailor! Your wallet will thank you.
