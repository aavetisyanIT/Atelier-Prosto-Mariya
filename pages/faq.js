				<h2>What should you bring for fitting?</h2>
				<p className='paragraph'>
					Most clients who need something fitted try on their
					clothing. We always suggest bringing the relevant items
					of articles and accessories you plan to wears when you
					do wear your garment. Here are some ideas:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						For suit jackets needing tailoring please wear a
						shirt that you are most likely to wear with it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Dress alterations please wear the flats or heels
						that you would the night of the event.
					</li>
					<li>
						For custom alterations please bring in the
						accessories such as rhinestones, Swarovski
						crystals, ribbons, etc. that you plan to have
						tailored to the piece of clothing. We may also
						help provide you with examples.
					</li>
					<li>
						Undergarments you plan on wearing generally with
						dresses. We do offer bust cups as well to be sewn
						in.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>What to wear for custom measurements?</h2>
				<p className='paragraph'>
					When taking a measurement please wear light clothing
					that does not add too much bulk to your body. Remove
					unnecessary items from your pockets. This will help our
					team members better measure you. Take a moment breathe
					and relax feel comfortable as you normally would. Avoid
					stiffening up and just a normal posture.
					<br />
					<br />
					Posture and build: Achieving a good fit is not just
					about your garment’s measurements. It’s about the
					proportions. Each body type is different and your
					posture may change over time. Whether you like a style
					to be shorter, longer, or in the middle is a matter of
					preference and alterations but things do change such as
					height and weight.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Do I need to worry about my pants shrinking after I
					alter them?
				</h2>
				<p className='paragraph'>
					To be on the safe side, always wash/dry clean your
					garments prior to any alterations. This will ensure the
					long-term fit and avoid any shrinking concerns (no pun
					intended).
				</p>
				<hr className='major' />
				<h2>Where do the clothes actually get altered/tailored?</h2>
				<p className='paragraph'>
					All alterations take place at the shop you bring your
					garments to. We do not outsource any of our work. This
					guarantees that your work is done to your specification
					and allows us to contact you directly for any questions
					or preferences.
				</p>

					Yes. We have made many custom dresses, suits, skirts,
					other special occasion gowns, and costumes. If you
