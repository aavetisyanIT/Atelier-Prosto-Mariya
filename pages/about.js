				<h2>A Passion for Thread and Helping People Through Clothing</h2>
				<p>
					I’ve been sewing for over 30 years. This complex art has captured
					me so much that I’m still not bored with it. And I don’t think I
					ever will be. I love it all, from designing to sewing to fixing
					to creating!
				</p>
				<p>
					Like so many others, I’ve always believed in the importance of
					loving what you do. I built Atelier Prosto Mariya based on my
					passion for sewing. Owning this business has given me the
					opportunity to pass my craft on to younger generations and use my
					skills to help others. Because being a seamstress so much, it
					barely feels like work! Because I’m passing the craft onto my
					daughter, Atelier Prosto Mariya has become a family business. My
					daughter has inherited not only my skills but also my love for
					the art. My work and my family have always been my top two
					priorities. Owning my own business and working with my daughter
					allows me to do both at the same time!
				</p>

				<h2>Third Generation Seamstress</h2>
				<p>
					I grew up in a small village in Ukraine. Because my mother was
					also a tailor, sewing is in my blood. She would make “valyanky”
					for herself, her family, neighbors, and friends who could not
					afford to buy the latest expensive ones. This gave me clear
					insight into how important the work of a seamstress is. It’s more
					than just clothes. It’s about helping people! Because I was
					around sewing so often, my passion for the craft developed at an
					early age. My mom had always wanted me to be a doctor, but I
					never had the same passion for medicine that I did for thread. I
					wanted to follow in her footsteps
				</p>

				<h2>The Power of Clothing</h2>
				<p>
					I decided to study in college then internship. Eventually, I
					learned how to make my own clothing. I vividly remember the
					process of making my first dress. It was a true labor of love: a
					stunning fiery red with black accents. The dress reflected my
					strength as a person and the challenges I had overcome to
					accomplish all that I had. The dress became a sort of good luck
					charm for me. I wore it to meet my now-husband’s parents for the
					first time. The dress helped give me confidence at a time when I
					felt my most self-conscious.
				</p>
				<p>
					This experience taught me the power that high-quality clothing
					can have on the one who’s wearing it. I love when my clothing can
					give others that same power. Whether I’m making a custom garment,
					repairing a well-loved blouse, or hemming a wedding dress for
					someone’s special day, doing my job brings me so much joy!
				</p>
