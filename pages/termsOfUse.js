				<h2>Product Information, Specifications and Ordering</h2>
				<h3>PRODUCT INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					All features, Content, specifications, products and
					prices of products and services described or depicted
					on this Website are subject to change at any time
					without notice. All prices and denominations are
					listed, and concomitant transactions are conducted, in
					United States Dollars. Certain weights, measures and
					similar descriptions may be approximate and are
					provided for convenience purposes only. Pictures of
					products on the Website and our catalogues are
					representative of actual products. However, some
					merchandise may have slightly different cosmetic
					appearances. The "List" price featured on the Website
					or our catalogue is our estimation of a retail price
					for the product at issue. We attempt to ensure that
					information on the Website is complete, accurate and
					current. Despite our efforts, the information on this
					Website may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete or
					out of date. We make no representation as to the
					completeness, accuracy or correctness of any
					information on the Website. For example, products
					included on this Website may be unavailable, may have
					different attributes than those listed, or may actually
					carry a different price than that stated on the
					Website. All trademarks denoted by Atelier Prosto
					Mariya are registered trademarks and are the sole
					property of the owners of such trademarks, many of whom
					are other than Atelier Prosto Mariya.
				</p>
				<h3>LISTINGS; ORDER ACCEPTANCE POLICY</h3>
				<p>
					Listings on the Website are not an offer to sell goods
					or services; rather, they are advertisements to receive
					offers. All orders are subject to review and acceptance
					by us. As all prices are subject to change, your order
					may not be accepted or we may have to communicate price
					changes or availability issues to you after you place
					your order.
					<br />
					<br />
					Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order
					confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your
					order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer
					to sell. We reserve the right at any time after receipt
					of your order to accept or decline your order for any
					reason. We reserve the right at any time after receipt
					of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply
					less than the quantity you ordered of any item. We may
					require additional verifications or information before
					accepting any order.
				</p>
				<h3>PRODUCT ORDERS; QUANTITY LIMITS AND DEALER LIMITS</h3>
				<p>
					We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to limit
					the number of items purchased per person, per
					household, or per order. These restrictions also may be
					applicable to orders placed by the same account, the
					same credit card, and also to orders that use the same
					billing and/or shipping address or are placed by
					dealers. The inclusion of any products or services on
					the Website at a particular time does not imply or
					warrant that these products or services will continue
					to be available.
				</p>
				<h3>CREDIT CARD/DEBIT CARD AUTHORIZATIONS</h3>
				<p>
					An authorization on a credit or debit card is a hold
					against your bank's credit card spending limit. When
					the goods are shipped, a charge for the total amount of
					the order shipped will be sent to your credit card
					bank. Your bank should release the authorization when
					the charge is received. A charge is the only time a
					transfer of funds is completed; an authorization is not
					a transfer of funds.
				</p>
				<h3>OUR SATISFACTION GUARANTEE AND RETURN POLICY</h3>
				<p>
					<br />
					<br />
					Your satisfaction is our goal. Every product we sell is
					backed by our 365-day Satisfaction Guarantee.
					<br />
					<br />
					If a product you purchase fails to meet your needs,
					simply contact us for a return label and return form.
					Returns received within 60 days from the date of order
					are eligible for replacement, exchange or refund.
					Returns received after 60 days (and within the 365-day
					Satisfaction Guarantee period) may be returned for a
					store credit towards future purchases.
					<br />
					<br />
					This is a summary only; you should review our complete
					Return Policy and Procedure in our FAQs.
